# potato_leaf_disease_prediction
This project is a Potato Leaf Disease Prediction System that utilizes deep learning to identify and classify diseases affecting potato leaves. By analyzing images of potato leaves, the system can detect diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, or classify the leaf as Healthy.
ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Deep Learning Model (CNN-based) for image classification
âœ… Disease Detection for Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves
âœ… User-friendly Interface for uploading and analyzing images
âœ… High Accuracy achieved through model training on a large dataset
âœ… Flask Web App (optional) for easy deployment
